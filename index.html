        <h2>Places To Visit</h2>
        <p>Nepal is a tiny, landlocked country surrounded by two giant neighbors, 
            China and India. When it comes to adventure travel, Nepal is one of 
            the best destinations in the world, with challenging trekking routes, 
            breathtaking glaciers, and picturesque valleys. But even if you have no 
            desire to spend a single day in hiking boots, there is so much to see and 
            do in this unique country. But there are definitely some things worth knowing 
            before you visit.</p>

        <h5>Cultures</h5>
        <p>About 80 percent of Nepal’s residents are Hindu, 
            10 percent are Buddhist, and the rest are a mixed bag.
             The major religious festivals are a cross-pollination 
             of both Hinduism and Buddhism. You’ll see as many Hindu 
             symbols and temples around Nepal as you will statues and
              devotions to the Buddha. If you want to be respectful
               in Nepal, there are a few golden rules: 
            Don’t touch people on the head (the most sacred part of the body), 
            don’t point with your finger (use a flat hand or your chin), don’t 
            eat or pass food with your left hand (considered dirty and unhygienic), 
            show respect by using both hands to give or receiving something 
            (including money), remove your shoes before entering a temple or 
            monastery, and always walk around a stupa clockwise.</p>

    <section class="language">
        <h6>Language</h6>
        <p>Nepali is an Indo-Aryan language, similar to Hindi spoken in India
             (Indian travelers should understand enough to get around). 
             English is a secondary language spoken mostly in large cities like Kathmandu. 
             Outside Kathmandu, English is spoken less, but getting around is still manageable. 
             Simply smile and say Namaste, which is a traditional Hindu greeting meaning, essentially, 
             “the divine spirit with me, bows to the divine spirit within you” or “my soul 
             recognizes your soul.” You’ll say Namaste to everyone, and everyone will say it to you, 
             but unlike at the end of your yoga class back home, here it’s used for pretty much everything
              — a greeting, goodbye, and even “pardon me, you’re in my way.” When saying Namaste, you hold 
              your hands as if in prayer. Another good word to know is “thank you,” dhanyavad, pronounced: dahn-ya-vahd.</p>

                        <p>According to the 2011 census of Nepal, the country has 122 major languages. Nepali is spoken by 78% 
                            of the population either as first or second language and has official language status.</p>

                        <h7>English</h7>
                        <p>Many Nepalese speak English as a second or foreign language, with English use being most prevalent 
                            among city dwellers residing in Kathmandu (the capital of Nepal). Although Nepali is the native 
                            language, English is the primary language used for business in Nepal.</p>

                        <p>Nepali or Nepalese is spoken by 70 percent of the people in Nepal, and Hindi is spoken by a mere 41 
                            percent of the people in India. Both languages are spoken in India as well as Nepal</p>
